Hello Future, 

Marion County TPEP intern. I am making this metadata file that that you are orientated to 
all the code I had written for my Public Health Capstone Project in SP'23. 

I have tried to make this code as interpretable in the event that you do not have any coding 
skills. So hopefully, my R comments make sense. But do know that I have a very unique 
method of coding. 

Organization: 
  - Code contains the all of the code outlined in the Appendix of my capstone document, 
      and the associated html files
  - Data contains both the raw data that I generated prior to the statistical analysis 
      and the code I generate after Appendix D1
  - OutPuts contains the tables and figures made across all of the files within Code
  
```{r loading initial package}
install.packages("here")
library(here)

# this package creates paths relative to the top-level directory
# this makes organizing workflows easier
# additioanlly, it allows for code to be immediately used by others upon download 
# or at least this is the intention of the code
here()
```
